## 📌 Project Description

This project visualizes insights from the Brazilian e-commerce dataset by Olist. Using data from orders, reviews, customers, and sellers, we built three dashboards to analyze performance across sales, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency. The visualizations aim to support decision-making and uncover patterns in online retail behavior.

### 🌟 Highlights & Insights

- Sales peaked during the year-end period, indicating potential seasonal effects on order volume and revenue.
- Southeastern states, especially São Paulo (SP), dominate in revenue, pointing to regional concentration.
- Most customers give high ratings, but delivery delays significantly increase the chances of receiving a 1–2 star review.
- High freight costs are often associated with small or single-item orders, suggesting inefficiencies in logistics.
- Clustering analysis reveals distinct customer segments by order size and shipping cost, which can inform fulfillment strategies.

### ⚠️ Limitations

- **Time range bias**: The dataset only covers a specific time window and may not reflect current trends.
- **Geographic gaps**: Geolocation and seller data may be incomplete or imprecise, affecting region-based analysis.
- **Missing features**: Key business attributes (marketing spend, return rate, some feature engineer, etc.) are not included.
